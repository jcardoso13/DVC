I want to thank my supervisor and Professor José Teixeira de Sousa for his eternal patience with me finishing this dissertation
and the opportunity to work on the Versat CGRA.
I would also like to acknowledge my friends and my parents, who are always there for me, and a special mention 
to my fiancée, who has supported me through my Bachelor's and Master's and has finally pushed me to finish this document.
