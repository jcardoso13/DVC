I want to thank my supervisor and Professor José Teixeira de Sousa for his eternal patience with me finishing this dissertation
and the opportunity to work on the Versat CGRA.
I would also like to acknowledge my friends and my parents who are always there for me and a special mention 
to my fiancée who has supported me all the way through my Bachelor and Masters and has pushed me to finally finish this document.
