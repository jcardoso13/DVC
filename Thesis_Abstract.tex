In this thesis, the problem of accelerating the execution of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) using Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) is studied,
with special emphasis on compiling a DNN description into code that runs on a
CPU/CGRA system. This topic is a vast one, so this thesis focuses on simulating
DeepVersat, a CPU/CGRA system suitable for DNN, and tools for running any
Convolutional Neural Network on DeepVersat. The tools presented in this thesis
allow for architectural exploration and optimization, and a dramatic reduction
of the development time.
